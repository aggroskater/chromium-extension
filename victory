Technically speaking, this shouldn't work according to 

http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting.html

which states that those serving their own crx files must use either

1.) Content type "application/x-chrome-extension"

or

2.) File suffix is ".crx" and both of the following are true
2.1) The file is NOT served with "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff"
2.2) The file IS served with an empty string for the content type or 
one of the following: "text/plain", "application/octet-stream",
"unknown/unknown", "application/unknown", or "*/*"

However, I suspect this is only relevant for having the Chromium browser 
detect the crx file as an installable so that it may automatically prompt 
the user to install it rather than download it as a file. Because doing the 
check for updates now option in the extensions panel works and pulls the 
update.
